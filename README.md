## Description
In all fairness, this project was started to help me in the process of learning kotlin. 
At first the focus was on the conversion of the screens then it quickly changed to implementation of the MVVM architecture.

The project has two screens only but uses the MVVM architecture in its entirety from separating views, viewmodel, and the model so as to separate concerns for ease in development and debugging.
It also uses the room database and a few more libraries to set base for projects that will come after this.

It learned so much working on these two screens.
